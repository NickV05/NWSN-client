      <p>
        Violence is a lead cause of homelessness for women and children, and the
        vast majority of those served by womenâ€™s and family shelter programs
        have histories of gender-based violence, domestic/family violence,
        trafficking, abuse and crime victimization. For many, the layers of
        complex trauma begin in early childhood, are lifelong and destined to be
        repeated without therapeutic interventions and multi-faceted levels of
        support to help women and children heal, reclaim their lives and build
        the foundation for safer, brighter futures. The NWSN helps advance the
        standard of care and capacity of shelters and safe havens to serve
        women, youth and children in need all across the nation by providing its
        Members with education, tools and resources for trauma-informed, best
        practices to address the complex needs of sheltered women and children,
        so that they can blossom into who they are meant to be. We transform the
        trauma of homelessness into windows of opportunity. Our comprehensive
        resource library, information sharing, education, and trainings are
        multi-faceted and include:
