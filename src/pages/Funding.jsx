      <h3>RESOURCES & FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES</h3>
      <p>
        Through community outreach, research and advocacy, the NWSN helps its
        members identify and secure additional resources and funding
        opportunities, both public and private, as well as in-kind goods and
        services, to support their life saving work. While the NWSN is
        relatively new, we are already working on initiatives to secure grant
        funding for our members where it is needed most. In the meantime, we are
        researching as many sources as possible to keep you abreast of new
        opportunities and get you connected. Our Public Policy Initiatives are
        laser focused on securing additional Federal funding for womenâ€™s and
        family shelters and safe haven programs across the country. We are in an
        ongoing dialogue with Federal officials to that end. The NWSN is also
        here to support your State and local advocacy initiatives with research,
        information, statistics, support letters and more. We can help connect
        you to other shelters and safe haven programs that can share their
        experience and advice, as needed. Be sure to check out our Comprehensive
        Resource Library. The NWSN leverages its strength in numbers and the
        power of the network to negotiate with Partners and Providers to secure
        discounted goods and services for the benefit of members. The NWSN also
        directs free and donated goods and services to members throughout the
        network, where needed most. Those savings go to the bottom line for our
        members and help advance their mission and impact to end and prevent
        homelessness all across the country. Check out the Quick Links below and
        be sure to check in on the Network Forum regularly for our Resources and
        Funding Opportunities Alerts.
