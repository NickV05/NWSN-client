      <h3>OUR MEMBERS</h3>
      <p>
        The NWSN is a growing community of womenâ€™s and family shelters, safe
        haven programs and regional, state and local associations, networks and
        coalitions that provide sanctuary to millions of women and children in
        need all across the nation. NWSN members are situated in local
        communities, large and small, too often with a varied patchwork of
        funding sources available to them to carry out the important work of
        providing safe, supportive shelter for women and children in need. They
        share our commitment to providing trauma-informed care and deep
        protective factors, supportive services and enriched resources to help
        women and children in need successfully transition. We need more
        resources to provide enriched, trauma-informed sanctuary and supportive
        services for women and children.
