      <h2>Public Policies Initiative to End and Prevent Homelessness</h2>
      <p>
        Our nation is facing a public health crisis in growing numbers of people
        experiencing homelessness in our country. In the wake of the pandemic
        and decades of failed social and public policies, homelessness is
        reaching epic levels across our nation, impacting most severely women
        and children. The National Women’s Shelter Network is taking action. At
        its Inaugural National Conference in Miami, Florida, in September 2023,
        the NWSN convened over 220 shelter leaders and other experts from across
        the country to discuss the intersections of gender-based violence and
        homelessness, trauma-informed best practices and solutions to ending
        homelessness, and the need for more resources for women and children and
        the shelters that serve them, calling on leaders at all levels of
        government, business, finance,{" "}

        from DOJ, HUD, HHS, FEMA, DOE, DOL and more (link to photos and position
        paper we delivered), to raise awareness of what is happening every day
        on the ground in shelters across America. The dialogue between Federal
        Officials and the NWSN continues. Stay tuned for more!

        The NWSN has issued an eight-point public policy agenda that is laser
        focused on ending and preventing women’s and children’s homelessness in
        our country and providing women’s and family shelters and safe haven
        programs with the resources they need to implement trauma-informed, best
        practices to heal, support, uplift and successfully transition those
        they serve. The NWSN{" "}

          Plan to Address the Gender Specific Needs of Women and their Children
          and Intersections between Gender Based Violence and Homelessness{" "}
        </i>
        includes the following key policy issues:
      </p>
      <div className="table2">
        <p>
          #1 Urgently needed funding for women’s homeless shelters and safe
          haven programs tailored to meet the gender specific needs of women and
          their children, with trauma-informed supportive services and enriched
          resources, recognizing gender-based violence and related trauma is a
          lead cause of homelessness for women and children.
        </p>

        <p>
          #2 Funding for capital repairs and improvements for shelters and safe
          haven programs for women and their children, to build the facilities
          and organizational capacity of programs to serve women and children of
          all ages and abilities, in trauma-informed, universally accessible,
          healthful, environmentally sensitive, child friendly, and welcoming
          environments, offering privacy, dignity, and suitable to their special
          needs, and further, to establish shelters and safe havens for women
          and children experiencing homelessness in communities that have none
          so that no woman or child will be forced to survive on the street or
          remain in abusive circumstances, risking further harm or death.
        </p>

        <p>
          #3 Funding for truly affordable, permanent housing for those with
          extremely low-income, both public and private, with long-term
          vouchers, subsidies and programs that limit rent to one-third of an
          individual’s or family’s income, so that they can afford to put food
          on the table, care for children, cover utilities, medical expenses,
          transportation and other basic costs of living, to remain stably
          housed.
        </p>

        <p>
          #4 Long-term/permanent residences with embedded, trauma-informed,
          mental health care and supportive services are needed for those with
          severe and persistent mental illness or other special needs who need
          assistance with daily living activities to achieve a meaningful
          quality of life, too many of whom die on our streets today, sited in
          the communities they call home.
        </p>

        <p>
          #5 A key element to ending and preventing homelessness is a truly
          affordable living wage and/or level of income, with wages and income
          tied to to the Federally determined fair market rents by geographic
          location to help adjust for differences across the nation and everyone
          can afford rental housing where they live, potentially lifting
          millions of individuals and families out of homelessness.
        </p>
        <p>
          #6 Paid maternity leave for expectant and new mothers, across sectors,
          is needed for at least a 3 month period, longer in the case of health
          complications for either the mother and/or child. Paid maternity leave
          reduces financial stress and offers women and children critical
          financial support, advancing healthy development, mental well-being,
          prevents homelessness and assures greater housing stability.
        </p>
        <p>
          #7 Long-term, post-shelter exit, enriched supportive services, as
          needed, for women and children who have successfully transitioned from
          homelessness to secure hard-earned successes and to help them remain
          stably housed, address special needs and circumstances, and prevent
          cycling in and out of shelters.
        </p>
        <p>
          #8 A key element to ending and preventing homelessness is a truly
          affordable living wage and/or level of income, with wages and income
          tied to to the Federally determined fair market rents by geographic
          location to help adjust for differences across the nation and everyone
          can afford rental housing where they live, potentially lifting
          millions of individuals and families out of homelessness.
